      "text": "As the former Executive Officer for Promotions and Documentation of UP Irisâ€”a university-wide student organization\u2014I received and conducted training in the art of storytelling through photography. Today, I continue to draw inspiration and learnings from established photographers, both foreign and local, in order to hone my own craft. I mainly focus on concert and portrait photography. However, I do like to be well-rounded, and I don't mind venturing into street, landscape, and product photography every once in a while.",

For this activity, I generated the basic shapes using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). This let me define the
centroid and pseudo-radius (distance from the centroid to the midpoint of an edge) for each shape analytically,
and therefore, I know precisely what their dimensions and areas will be. The shapes are shown in Fig. 1, all
with size 1024 $x$ 1024.

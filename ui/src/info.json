          "body": "Modern signal acquisition technologies are made possible by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem (NST). However, this paradigm is extremely wasteful as the signal is compressed before storing it by systematically discarding imperceptible information. Compressive sensing (CS) aims to directly sense the relevant information. Current literature focus either on formulating more computationally-efficient algorithms, or methods which improve the reconstruction quality. In this paper, we quantify the reconstruction quality of compressively sampled speech with a perceptually intuitive metricâ€•the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ)â€•and with the standard average segmental SNR (SNRseg). The quality of recovery of compressively sampled speech evaluated using PESQ is dependent on the compression ratio, and independent of the number of subbands used to represent the signal in the spectrogram domain.",

This allows highly accurate signal recovery from incomplete frequency information. In this paper, we investigate the ability of compressive sampling to recover the higher harmonics of a recorded guitar signal. Sampling is done in the temporal domain, and the reconstruction is performed in the frequency domain. It is shown that even when taking a small number of random samples corresponding to some underlying sub-Nyquist rate, the base frequency, including up to fifth-order harmonics, can be recovered. The performance of three algorithms, namely least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and smoothed L0 norm (SL0) algorithm in terms of computation time and reconstruction error (cosine similarity) were investigated.",

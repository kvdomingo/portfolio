              Hi, I'm Kenneth V. Domingo! I am an applied physics graduate from the University of the
              Philippines-Diliman. For my undergraduate thesis, I joined the Instrumentation Physics Laboratory with a
              research concentration on signal, video, and image processing. In my spare time, I like to dabble a bit in
              various fields like music composition & production, photography, artificial intelligence, electronics, and
              bioinformatics, to name a few. I am also an alumni and former Executive Officer for Promotions and
              Documentation of UP Iris, a university-wide photography organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my latter college years, I took several online classes and tutorials on web and mobile development
              (yup, not exactly related to my course). Because I primarily used Python in my research, my go-to stack is
              Django-React.js, and I primarily deploy web apps to Heroku and Vercel. Currently, I have several completed
              and ongoing web projects that I developed on my own, and I am also looking for web/software
              development-related jobs.
            </p>
            <p>Feel free to contact me for inquiries, collaborations, and other concerns!</p>

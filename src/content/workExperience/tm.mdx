- Led a cross-functional team of 7 engineers to architect and develop the UNICEF
  [Giga DataOps Platform](https://sync.giga.global), a fully
  [open-source](https://github.com/unicef/giga-dagster) master data management platform
  built in coordination with [Giga](https://giga.global), a UNICEF-ITU joint initiative whose mission is
  to connect all schools to the internet by 2030. V1.0 of the Platform was launched in September 2024 and
  was presented at the
  [Open Source Summit](https://osseu2024.sched.com/event/1iSnq/global-school-connectivity-dataops-platform-shilpa-arora-unicef)
  in Vienna later that month. At launch, the Platform managed data for over 2.1M school records across 141
  countries, with near-real-time connectivity data for 93k schools updating every few minutes. The Platform
  was also being leveraged by 2 downstream applications with 5k monthly users.

- Developed a data analytics platform for a foreign agricultural company: optimized
  the data lake setup for near-realtime updates of logistic movements and
  validation of the delivery of burnt produce. Daily tasks involved orchestration and
  scheduling of ELT tasks and SQL queries via Dagster, and automating replication
  of hybrid cloud deployment environments via Terraform.

- Developed [GenAI applications](https://thinkingmachin.es/llm-solutions/) for several enterprise clients in
  the financial sector, leveraging Azure OpenAI. Daily tasks involved designing responsive
  chat interfaces, and image processing to remove non-text elements in financial
  documents in order to prepare them for vector embedding for use in downstream
  RAG applications.

- Developed the [SDG Impact Tool](https://sdg-tool.goldstandard.org/) for
  [Gold Standard](https://goldstandard.org) to digitize their process
  of reporting, validating, verifying, and tracking the contribution of project
  activities to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Daily tasks involved
  backend development in Django, frontend development in React, and
  automating infrastructure provisioning across multiple Google Cloud deployment
  environments using Terraform.

- Developed an internal geospatial analytics platform for a local telecommunications
  company: involved in migrating user interface components to a modern tech
  stack and increasing test coverage.

An [open-source](https://github.com/unicef/giga-data-ingestion) master data management platform developed with
[Giga](https://giga.global), a UNICEF x ITU initiative to connect all schools around the world to the internet by 2030.

- [Giga Sync](https://sync.giga.global) ([GitHub](https://github.com/unicef/giga-data-ingestion)) is the data
  ingestion portal, allowing users---such as country representatives, government agencies, and NGO partners---to
  upload school data in a variety of formats. Here, users can also monitor the progress of ingestion and quality check
  reports of their previously uploaded data.

- [Giga Dagster](https://dagster.giga.global) ([GitHub](https://github.com/unicef/giga-dagster)) is the heart of the
  data platform, responsible for orchestrating data tasks such as ingestion, transformation, and data quality checks.
  Data is stored in the data lake in the Delta Lake open table format, allowing various access methods and maintaining
  a full change history via the change data feed.

- [Giga Data Sharing](https://datasharing.giga.global) ([GitHub](https://github.com/unicef/giga-data-sharing)) allows
  open access to the school master data, subject to role-based access control. The API is compliant with the Delta
  Sharing Protocol, allowing users to interact with the data using the Delta Sharing client libraries.

- [Giga Superset](https://superset.giga.global) ([GitHub](https://github.com/unicef/giga-superset)) is the business
  intelligence platform, allowing data analysts to explore, visualize, and extract insights from the data stored in
  the data lake.

- [Giga Datahub](https://datahub.giga.global) ([GitHub](https://github.com/unicef/giga-datahub)) is the data catalog,
  allowing for the discovery of data stored in the data lake.

- Giga Trino ([GitHub](https://github.com/unicef/giga-trino)) is the query engine, allowing Delta Lake tables to be
  queried as SQL for business intelligence applications such as Superset.

- Giga Monitoring ([GitHub](https://github.com/unicef/giga-monitoring)) provides for the monitoring and logging of
  all deployed applications on UNICEF Giga's Kubernetes cluster.

#### Investigation of the potentials and electric fields of an arbitrary discrete charge distribution using multipole expansion

#### Physics

In electrostatics, a multipole expansion is a useful tool in approximating the behavior of electromagnetic potentials
and fields at a certain distance from a charge distribution. Multipole expansions are mathematical series that can be
truncated in order to approximate a function within a reasonable margin of error [[1](#Kinzel1998)]. The terms of the
multipole expansion are expressed in powers of the reciprocal distance from the origin [[2](#Griffiths1999)].

For an arbitrary, discrete charge distribution, the individual charges are assumed to have unit charge and are
point-like. Thus, the potential at any point $P$ defined by the position vector $\vec{r}$ is given by

<span id="eq-potential" class="mx-auto">
$
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{q_i}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i|}
  \end{equation}
$
</span>

where $\epsilon_0$ is the electric permittivity in a vacuum, $q_i$ is the the $i$th charge, and $\vec{r}_i$ is the
position vector from the origin to the $i$th charge. The electric field $\vec{E}$ is given by

<span id="eq-efield" class="mx-auto">
  $ \begin{equation}
  \vec{E}(\vec{r}) = -\nabla \Phi(\vec{r}) \end{equation}$
</span>

For $|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i| \rightarrow \infty$, the potential's multipole expansion up to the quadrupole term is given
by [[3](#Gradshteyn1994)]

<span id="eq-multipole" class="mx-auto">
$
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(\vec{r}) = \frac{q}{r} + \frac{\vec{p} \cdot \vec{r}}{r^3} + \frac{1}{2r^5}\vec{r}\vec{Q}\vec{r} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r^4}\right)
\end{equation}
$
</span>

where $q$ is the total charge, $\vec{p}$ is the dipole moment, and $\vec{Q}$ is the quadrupole tensor, given by

<span id="eq-charge" class="mx-auto">
  $ \begin{equation}q = \sum_{(i = 1)}^N q_i \end{equation}$
</span>

<span id="eq-dipole" class="mx-auto">
  $ \begin{equation}
  \vec{p} = \sum_{(i = 1)}^N q_i \vec{r}_i \end{equation}$
</span>

<span id="eq-quadrupole" class="mx-auto">
  $ \begin{equation}
  \vec{Q}_{kl} = \sum_{(i = 1)}^N q_i \left[ 3r_i^{k}r_i^{l} - \delta_{kl}\vec
  {r}_i^2 \right] \end{equation}$
</span>

where $\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\vec{r}_i^{(k)}$ is the $k$th component of $\vec{r}_i$.

With the random seed fixed for reproducibility, all the pre-execution code was defined as a `MultipoleExpansion` class
that takes an arbitrary even number $N$ of charges as the sole argument. The behavior of the electrostatic potentials
and fields was investigated by generating $N$ unit point charges, scattered within a $2 \times 2$ meter box on the
$x$-$y$ plane, centered at the origin. Random numbers were then drawn from a uniform distribution and inserted into the
row vectors of an array $\texttt{r}$. Thus, $\texttt{r}$ is a $3 \times N$ matrix, with the rows representing the
position vectors of the charges and all the $z$-components set to zero. From these vectors, the first half were assigned
to be the positive charges, while the latter half were assigned as the negative charges.

The electric potential was calculated for a $4 \times 4$ meter box on the $x$-$y$ plane by dividing it into a
$500 \times 500$ `meshgrid` for $x,y \in [-2,2]$, then evaluating the exact $\Phi$ for each point in the meshgrid
using ([1](#eq-potential)), and setting units of $4\pi\epsilon_0 = 1$. The potential was then plotted as a contour
projection on the $x$-$y$ plane using the `Axes3D` object [[4](#Hunter2007)]. To quantify the accuracy of the dipole and
quadrupole approximations, the potential was also plotted as a function of $y$ using the dipole and quadrupole
approximations given by ([3](#eq-multipole)), superimposed with the exact potential given by ([6](#eq-potential)).

Finally, the electric field was numerically evaluated using the central difference algorithm, as defined in
[[5](#Wilmott1995), [6](#Olver2013)], and was plotted using `streamplot` [[7](#Christian2015)].

#### Results

A total of ten (10) point charges were generated for the purposes of this paper. Their distribution on the $x$-$y$ plane
is shown in Figure&nbsp;[1a](#fig-plane). On the plane $z = 0.1$, they generate a potential, which is shown as contours
of constant $\Phi$ in Figure&nbsp;[1b](#fig-contour).

To compare the dipole and quadrupole approximations to the exact potential, a plane parallel to the $y$-axis was
selected and "cut" at the location $x = z = 0.1$. This plane was of particular interest due to the fact that it passes
close to two positive charges at $y \approx \pm 1$, and runs right in the middle of a dipole near $y \approx 0$.
Figure&nbsp;[2](#fig-approx) shows the result. It can be observed that the dipole approximation cannot account for both
of the positive charges on either side of the origin. This is due to the fact that the dipole approximation only allows
for two turning points in its curve. Even with the quadrupole correction, the actual potential is emulated only in a
very rough manner.

Calculation of the electric field yields the graphs in Figure&nbsp;[3](#fig-field). Figure&nbsp;[3a](#fig-field-2m)
shows the complex structure of the electric field for multiple charges, and as one moves away from the charge
distribution, the field appears to be that of a dipole, as can be seen in Figure&nbsp;[3b](#fig-field-64m).

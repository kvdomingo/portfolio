For this activity, I used the light source emittance data and leaf reflectance data that our group obtained from the
previous activities. Our reference light source is a 20W LED with a CCT of 6500K. All images were taken with a Nikon
D3400 with the white balance set to daylight. Since I could not find any spectral information about my camera online, I
got the spectral sensitivity data for the Nikon D70 [[2](#NaeLab2014)] instead.

#### Pre-processing

Since the number of data points of the spectra were not equal, I had to interpolate some data points so that they were
all equalized to the spectra with the most number of data points. Since all the intensities were relative, I then
normalized all the spectra to 1.

#### Color rendering

The color of the leaf was rendered digitally using the light emittance spectrum $M$, the leaf reflectance spectrum $R$,
and the camera spectral sensitivity $S$. The RGB values were generated according to [[1](#Soriano2019)]

<span id="eq-sensor-model" class="mx-auto">
$
\begin{eqnarray}
  Q_i = \int_{\mathrm{visible}} M(\lambda) R(\lambda) S_i(\lambda) \frac{\rm{d}}{\rm{d}\lambda} \\
	DN_i = \frac{\sum M(\lambda) R(\lambda) S_i(\lambda)}{\sum M(\lambda) S_i(\lambda)}
\end{eqnarray}
$
</span>

The actual and generated colors are shown in Fig.&nbsp;[1](#fig-render). We can see that the reconstructed color already
captures the general color of the leaf.

To further verify the calculations, we attempt to reconstruct the colors from a Macbeth Color Checker
[[1](#Soriano2019)]. The measured reflectances per patch was also provided and all computations proceed as before.
However, on the first attempt, the colors looked way off. I realized that I was still using the emittance from the light
source that we used in the previous activity, and that was most likely causing the error. On a hunch, I tried to search
for the spectral distribution of a standard D65 illuminant. I was able to obtain spectral data from [[3](#CVRL2007)],
and the final rendered colors are shown in Fig.&nbsp;[2](#fig-macbeth). From these figures, we can see that the rendered
colors are generally more saturated than the actual, while the gray patches are much less saturated.

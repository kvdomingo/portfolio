Today's activity involved the basics on digitally extracting values from hand-drawn plots. The image I used is
shown in Fig. [1](#fig:radial-profile). For the pixel coordinate extraction, I used Photoshop, and
for everything else, Python's `matplotlib` module.

<figure class="figure" id="fig:radial-profile">
  <img
    src={buildCldUrl("svip/186/2-Practical2/graph-image")}
    alt="Radial profiles of the electron excitation emission"
    class="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption class="figcaption">

    the laser-induced fluorescence $N_{vl}$ for lithium resonance line (670.8
    nm) [[1]](#kadota1984).

</figure>

In order to determine the pixel-to-centimeter conversion factor, I first tabulated the pixel coordinates of the x and
y-axis units. I noticed that the ticks were not equidistant, and that the x and y axes were not of the same scale, so I
performed linear regression by plotting the pixel vs cm values separately for both axes. The calibration curves can then
be obtained from Fig. [2](#fig:calibration). The conversion factors obtained were:

<span class="mx-auto" id="eq:calib">
$
\begin{align}
  x_{\mathrm{cm}} & = (0.02)x_{\mathrm{px}} - 6.62 \\
  y_{\mathrm{cm}} & = (-0.04)y_{\mathrm{px}} + 14.50
  \end{align}
  $
</span>

Using these conversion factors, it's simply a matter of plugging in pixel values into ([1](#eq:calib)) or
([2](eq:calib)) in order to extract the real cm units. In Fig. [1](#fig:radial-profile), we can see three elements:
a bell curve, a sigmoid-like curve, and an apparently straight line (it actually curves ever so slightly upward). To
extract the values of the bell curve, I simply took the pixel location of the center of the round markers. For the
sigmoid, I sampled at points on the line immediately adjacent to the hollow markers. For the dashed line, I sampled at
each x-axis unit.

<figure class="figure" id="fig:calibration">
  <img
    src={buildCldUrl("svip/186/2-Practical2/calibration_curves")}
    alt="Calibration curves for the x and y axes"
    class="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption class="text-center">

</figure>

After performing the necessary conversions, I could then plot my extracted curves while overlaying original image all in
one go. Because `matplotlib`'s `imshow` function displays images in terms of pixels, I had to specify its `extent` and
`aspect` parameters. To do this, I have to determine the length and width of the image as a whole, i.e., I have to
extend the axes of the original plot so that it encompasses the image as a whole. This task is already trivial since I
have already calculated conversion factors earlier. The end product is shown in Fig. [3](#fig:fit).

<figure class="figure" id="fig:fit">
  <img
    src={buildCldUrl("svip/186/2-Practical2/final_overlay")}
    alt="Original image overlayed with the extracted curves"
    class="w-full"
  />
  <figcaption class="text-center">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Even though it was suggested to use Paint, GIMP, and/or a spreadsheet software, I opted to use Photoshop and matplotlib
since I have been accustomed to using them and I believe I can work faster and more efficiently by using them.
Personally, I find using Excel cumbersome and _makalat tignan_ for data processing, and I am especially not fond of the
appearance of its plots.

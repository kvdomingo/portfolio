Give hostnames to your Docker applications running
on your local machine using [Traefik Proxy](https://traefik.io/). Traefik
(pronounced like traffic) is an _edge router_ that can
serve many functions such as reverse proxying and
load balancing.

#### Why would I want to give localhost applications hostnames?

Suppose you are working on multiple projects/apps at
the same time, and each of those projects are fully
Dockerized and have their own `docker-compose.yaml`
configurations. Or suppose that you have some apps that you
always want running in the background, like [Portainer](https://portainer.io).
If you are using a standard full-stack tech stack like mine,
chances are you have some application exposed on
port 8000 or 3000 (or both). You will run into problems
launching containers when you already have another
container listening on one of those common ports. You
might think a quick solution would be to just change
the port number of the second app, and you would be
right. However, this tactic quickly becomes unwieldy
as you have more apps running, and it can be easy to
forget which ports correspond to which apps.
The solution: forget port numbers and deal with
containers the same way the larger internet has dealt
with IP addresses: use hostnames.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Knowledge of docker-compose syntax
- Some knowledge of networking, particularly subnetting, CIDR blocks, RFC 1918 networks

> [!INFO]
>
> **RFC 1918 networks** are **private networks**,
> meaning they are used only for local networks and are not publicly routable on the internet. The RFC 1918 address ranges are divided into blocks as follows:
>
> - **the 16 block**: 192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 -192.168.255.255)
> - **the 12 block**: 172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255)
> - **the 8 block**: 10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 -10.255.255.255)
>
> Most devices understand this, so if you enter any of these addresses in a browser, they will always be searched within the local network and such requests will never leave said network.

For ideal results, we'll set up a single, global Traefik instance so that we can forget about it later on.

First, determine your Docker installation's default subnet. You can do this by running. Assuming you haven't tinkered around with it, the default is
`172.16.0.0/12`. If you have, then you already know enough to figure this out.
Find an unused `/16` CIDR block that falls within your Docker subnet. For our purposes, let's take
`172.20.0.0/16`. Then use the following Traefik config `traefik.yml`:

```yaml
api:
  dashboard: true
  debug: true

log:
  filePath: /var/log/traefik/traefik.log

accessLog:
  filePath: /var/log/traefik/access.log

entryPoints:
  http:
    address: ":80"

providers:
  docker:
    exposedByDefault: false
```

Let's break this down:

```yaml
api:
  dashboard: true
  debug: true
```

enables the Traefik dashboard and debug logging.

The top-level `log` and `accessLog` keys determine where the logs will be stored.

```yaml
entryPoints:
  http:
    address: ":80"
```

`entryPoints` tell Traefik what ports to expose to the host system. We create an entrypoint named
http and expose it on the host's port 80, which is the default HTTP port (we will deal with HTTPS in another blog).

```yaml
providers:
  docker:
    exposedByDefault: false
```

enables the Docker integration, but we want to control which apps should integrate with Traefik.

We then use the following `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
name: global-traefik

networks:
  default:
    name: traefik
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
          gateway: 172.20.0.1
    driver_opts:
      com.docker.network.bridge.name: traefik

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./traefik.yml:/traefik.yml:ro
    labels:
      traefik.enable: "true"
      traefik.docker.network: traefik
      traefik.http.routers.traefik.rule: Host(`traefik.localhost`)
      traefik.http.routers.traefik.entrypoints: http
      traefik.http.routers.traefik.service: api@internal
      traefik.http.services.traefik.loadbalancer.server.port: 8080
```

Let's break this down as well:

```yaml
ports:
  - 80:80
```

corresponds to the `http` entrypoint we set up in `traefik.yml`.

```yaml
volumes:
  - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
```

mounts the host's Docker socket into the container and give it read-only access to other running containers.

```yaml
labels:
  traefik.enable: "true"
  traefik.docker.network: traefik
  traefik.http.routers.traefik.rule: Host(`traefik.localhost`)
  traefik.http.routers.traefik.entrypoints: http
  traefik.http.routers.traefik.service: api@internal
  traefik.http.services.traefik.loadbalancer.server.port: 8080
```

Labels are the key to Traefik integration. We explicitly enable the integration of the
Traefik container itself with the Traefik proxy. We add a rule so that the Traefik dashboard
becomes accessible using the hostname `traefik.localhost`. Note that the hostname is
surrounded by backticks (<code>`</code>) and not quotes.

Finally, spin up the Traefik instance:

```shell
docker compose up --detach
```

In a browser, navigate to `traefik.localhost` to view the Traefik dashboard.

To try out our first app with a custom hostname, check out the following NGINX test
app `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
    image: bitnami/nginx:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      NGINX_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER: 8000
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

This is how we would normally write a Docker app, and it would be accessible on
`localhost:8000`. To make it work with Traefik, we need to modify it a bit:

```yaml
networks:
  traefik:
    external: true

services:
  nginx:
    image: bitnami/nginx:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      NGINX_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER: 8000
    networks:
      - traefik
    labels:
      traefik.enable: "true"
      traefik.http.routers.nginx.rule: Host(`nginx-test-app.localhost`)
      traefik.http.routers.nginx.entrypoints: http
      traefik.http.services.nginx.loadbalancer.server.port: 8000
```

Launch the test app instance:

```shell
docker compose up --detach
```

The app should now be accessible on `nginx-test-app.localhost`.

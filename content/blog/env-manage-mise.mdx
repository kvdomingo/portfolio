Recently, I found myself reformatting several servers and switching between development
machines. I've been automating the setup of system packages, command line tools, and system
settings using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). With this, I could also install programming
languages and other CLI tools that are not available via the system package manager (i.e. via
network installers or shell scripts). However, I frequently run into a couple of problems:

- In my line of work, I often work on multiple projects that potentially use different versions
  of the same tools/programming languages. It's not always straightforward nor possible to install and
  switch between versions of these tools.

- I can't tell if a tool has updates unless I check the tool's website or if the tool has a
  self-update feature.

To resolve the first problem, I've been using [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and
[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage different versions of Python and Node.js,
respectively. However, this will quickly become unweildy if I need a version manager for each tool,
and I use A LOT of tools. I eventually stumbled upon [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/), which is
essentially "one manager to replace them all".

However, this doesn't solve the second problem, and `asdf` makes the terminal feel sluggish
at times. I recently discovered [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/), which solves both problems,
doesn't perceivably affect terminal interactions, and has a lot more supported tools through
the [`mise` registry](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html). It also doubles as a task runner, though
I prefer to use [`task`](https://taskfile.dev/) for that, so I won't cover that use case here.

`mise` is a polyglot tool version manager and is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. For this
post, I'll be focusing on a WSL setup, since this is what I daily drive.

To install `mise` on WSL, simply run

```shell
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

If all goes well, running `mise` should print the help text. If you get an error along the lines
of `command not found`, you need to add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH`:

```shell
# bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc

# zsh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
. ~/.zshrc
```

To enable the `mise` registry, you need to enable the experimental flag. Create a file at the
location `~/.config/mise/config.toml` if it does not yet exist and add the following:

```toml
[experimental]
enable = true
```

To see all available tools, run

```shell
mise registry
```

Now for the fun part, we can install specific versions of tools to be used globally. For example:

```shell
mise use -g python@latest node@latest go@latest
```

This is great to quickly get up and running with the latest versions of tools. However, one of
`mise`'s powerful features is setting constraints for versions. Typically, you won't always use
the latest version because you need to wait for libraries to update and be compatible. You aren't
limited to specifying full version numbers - you can specify minor or major versions:

```shell
mise use -g python@3.12 node@22 go@1.22.4
```

An even more powerful feature is specifying what I like to call a "variable version". In 
my use case, I want to enforce the following constraints:

- stay one *minor* version behind the latest Python version
- stay one *patch* version beind the latest Go version
- stay on the LTS version for Node.js

I achieve this as follows:

```shell
mise use -g python@sub-0.1:latest node@lts go@sub-0.0.1:latest
```

The `sub-0.1:latest` syntax basically translates to "the latest version subtract 0.1". As of writing,
the latest minor version of Python is 3.13, so `mise` will install version 3.12. When 3.14 is
released, `mise` will automatically upgrade to 3.13. `mise` will automatically check for tool
version updates, and you can update all tools by running

```shell
mise up -y
```

How then does this become reproducible on multiple machines? `mise` stores the information about
install tool versions in the same `mise.toml` file you created earlier. After running the above
commands, your `mise.toml` file should look like this:

```toml
[settings]
experimental = true

[tools]
python = "sub-0.1:latest"
node = "lts"
go = "sub-0.0.1:latest"
```

You can then copy this to other machines by including `mise.toml` as part of your dotrepo,
which deserves its own blog post.

How do we now use different versions of tools for different projects? So far, we've been installing
tools globally, but we can install tools locally to a project by navigating to the project directory
and running the same commands as above, but omitting the `-g` (global) flag. This will create a new
`mise.toml` file in the project directory with the tool versions for that project, which should
be committed to version control.
